learning objectives
* sets: collections of unique elements, all meeting some criteria
* defining sets with clear yes/no criteria
* javascript types & typeof

there is not much exercise to be completed, this is examples to be studied and explained.  the main benefit will be learning to understand types in this way, and the vocab that goes along.
